# Hockey_Dashboard

Flask application to host a Hockey Stats Dashboard as complement of the HockeyStats project.

# Motivation

The main motivation of this project is to build a Flask application with a dashboard to host the results of my data analysis work.

# File descriptions

# Credits

The Data set was obtained from Kaggle's user [Martin Ellis](https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis). Thanks a ton Martin!! It is super hard to find such quality data for the NHL.

I use a lot functions and techniques I have learned (and borrowed) from Jeremy Howard from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/). I cannot thank Jeremy enough for all his work and courses.
